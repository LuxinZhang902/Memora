# Screenshots

Place the Memora interface screenshot here as `memora-screenshot.png`.

The screenshot should show:
- The query input: "When is the last time I renew my driver license?"
- The AI response with file citation
- The Evidence Gallery showing the document
- The clean, modern UI with dark theme

Current screenshot shows the hybrid search successfully finding the driver license preparation document even though the query uses "renew" and the document says "preparation" - demonstrating semantic understanding.
